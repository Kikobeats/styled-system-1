## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/image.png)

This is a continuation of the work done by jxnblk.

The project is a set of addons for styling and live updating components based on a prop architecture rather than using pure styled-components or other styling format.

## Built With

This project has been built using a couple of tools from my Techstack repo, feel free to check that out.

### Installation

```sh
npm install @techstack/styled-system

## Usage

I don't currently have my own version of the docs but the original ones should very closely match.
