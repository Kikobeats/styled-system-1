# Versions

## Pre V1

Any version that is pre V1 is styled-components v5 compatible.

## V1

Compatible with styled-components v6 (unsure about v5 and below).

## V2

Hopefully I will be able to confirm that it works with emotion but as I don't program using emotion myself I am unable
to test this if anyone who uses emotion wants to help out that would be great. There will be a V2 branch for this to be
developed into.
